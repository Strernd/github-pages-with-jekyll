title: "The problem with mass adoption"

Crypto evangelists are promising the inevitable mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. There is a set of unique problems that will make mass adoption of crypto problematic, if not impossible. Crypto will not face mass adoption because of unattractive usage costs and bad user experience due to fractionalization or will part ways with its decentralised nature.

## Hey crypto, how is it going?

Even in the current state where crypto is still very far away from mass adoption for use cases besides pure speculation, we can already see fees that largely exceed those of centralized finance. At the same time, the crypto world is in a deeply fractionalized state which leads to a lot of problems that in return spawn their own solutions that demand a share of the users' money.  
While crypto would be able to handle most types of financial products from simply transacting values between parties to lending and trading, these kinds of transactions are more expensive, oftentimes harder to use and easier to scam than their traditional finance counterpart offerings.  
At the time of writing 12 of the top 20 tokens ranked by market cap are network tokens. The most famous network for decentralized finance operations is Ethereum. The basic transaction of values costs between 15$ and 50$, sometimes even up to 200$ in fees depending on network congestion. For more complex operations like trading, the network fees are more in the realm of 50$ to 500$. It's easy to see that people who wish to interact with financial services and don't have a transaction value of at least several thousand dollars will immediately lose a large fraction of their transactions worth just in network fees.

One could move its business to another chain, that has a higher throughput and lower fees than Ethereum but is then confronted with a new unique set of problems.

## Crypto utopia
For the sake of the argument let's just assume that every single person, government, and organization wishes to conduct their transactions decentralized in the crypto world: Paying taxes, receiving a salary, buying groceries, taking a loan, etc.
The positive aspect would be that the centralized gatekeepers of the crypto world, which take 1 to 5% of your money each time you want to move in or out of a crypto network, would not be needed anymore. 

Since we're talking about cryptocurrencies it's important to recall the **central feature of cryptocurrencies: decentralization.** Every transaction is recorded multiple times. Every node keeps a copy of the ledger. 100, 1.000, or 10.000 machines will have to acknowledge every single transaction.   
This amount of redundancy implies a hefty performance overhead. In traditional, centralized systems the opposite approach is followed. There are multiple nodes and each transaction has to be validated by one. This kind of sharding allows for a level of throughput, that cryptocurrencies can never achieve due to their decentralized nature. 

As a direct consequence of this firstly a lot more computation power is needed to handle the world's transaction traffic and secondly no single network would be able to deal with the traffic. If we take [700 billion transactions per year](https://worldpaymentsreport.com/non-cash-payments-volume-2/) as a lower bound for our estimated traffic we can calculate how many networks with the same throughput as Ethereum would be needed to handle this.

The number of transactions per block in the Ethereum networks fluctuates [between 1.500 and 2.500 transactions.](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block) With an average block time of 13.2 seconds per block, this would amount to 150 transactions per second, 13 million transactions per day, or 4.7 billion per year. So we would need ~150 Etherum networks to keep up with the traffic. This is only a very low bound because all the internal bookkeeping of financial applications, that runs on servers in the background, is not counted as a transaction per se, but will have to be done in Smart Contracts on the blockchain, so will yield additional overhead.  

### Why decentralised networks can't handle the traffic
- alot of data history
- consensus over thousands transaction per second
- layer solutions
### The effects of fractionalization

To handle the traffic there would have to be a high amount of different networks, which will bring even more problems: 
- Each network will likely come with its own (gas) token. So there will still be the need for trading different gas tokens. The eternal competition between different networks will result in speculative pricing of the tokens. Imagine not being able to afford food a week later, because the token in which the salary was paid dropped by 80%.
- Parties will have funds fractionalized across multiple chains due to the fractionalized use of different chains.
- Moving between networks will take substantial amounts of fees.
- Every network might have different applications from different providers. Keeping an overview of what to do on which network will be a nightmare.
- The fractionalization will lead to centralized services spawning and taking fees to enable payments for organizations. Thus making the decentralization dispensable.
- The overhead of multiple existing networks and the required communication of those, in turn, increases the number of transactions needed.
- If a network turns out to be superior in one way or the other (e.g. services offered) it will attract more traffic and create fee bidding wars. For individuals who don't wish to transact in the realm of multiple thousand dollars, this might result in a value lock-in. 
- Abandonment of chains can lead to value lock-in.
- Incentives for validators of the networks might change regularly with price speculation of the network tokens. A network that isn't running at its capacity limit is less attractive for validators.
- The added complexity will lead to more opportunities to be scammed. Users need to be highly informed to not lose more money than necessary in day-to-day activities. (As an example take the knowledge you need to have about pools and transactions when trading small-cap tokens in decentralized exchanges to not get ripped off by bots.)
- And a lot more nightmarish problems.

As mentioned before conducting the same kind of operations in the crypto-space requires more computation capacity than doing it centralized. Efficient, centralized solutions thus can offer the same services for fractions of the price. Judging from what we see in today's world most people don't seem to have a problem with sticking to centralized organizations (Google, Facebook, etc.). As long as crypto won't be easier to use and cheaper (spoiler: it never can be) than their centralized counterparts mass adoption will never happen.
